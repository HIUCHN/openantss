  # Universal Comments Visibility Fix

  1. Changes
    - Create a more robust comments policy that ensures ALL users can see comments on public posts
    - Add database functions to handle comment operations more reliably
    - Create indexes for optimal performance
    - Add real-time subscription support for comments

  2. Security
    - Maintains security by only showing comments on accessible posts
    - Allows users to see their own comments regardless of post visibility
    - Ensures comments on public posts are visible to everyone

  3. Performance
    - Optimized indexes for fast comment loading
    - Efficient policy checks
